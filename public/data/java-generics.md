## Java / Generics
**Q:** What are Generics in Java?
**A:**
- Introduced in Java 5, Generics allow you to parameterize types.
- They enable classes, interfaces, and methods to work with different data types while providing compile-time type safety.
- Example: `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();` ensures only Strings can be added.

**Q:** What are the main benefits of using Generics?
**A:**
1. Type Safety: The compiler catches type mismatches at compile-time rather than throwing a `ClassCastException` at runtime.
2. Elimination of Casting: You don't need to manually cast objects when retrieving them from a collection.
3. Code Reusability: You can write a single algorithm or class that works with many different types.

## Java / Generics
**Q:** What is Type Erasure?
**A:**
- It is a process where the Java compiler removes all generic type information during compilation.
- For example, `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` both become the raw type `List` in the generated bytecode.
- This was done to ensure backward compatibility with older versions of Java that did not have generics.

**Q:** What are Wildcards in Generics?
**A:**
- The question mark `?` represents an unknown type.
- Unbounded Wildcard (`?`): Can be anything.
- Upper Bounded Wildcard (`? extends T`): The type must be `T` or a subclass of `T`. Useful for reading data.
- Lower Bounded Wildcard (`? super T`): The type must be `T` or a superclass of `T`. Useful for writing data.

## Java / Generics
**Q:** What is a Bounded Type Parameter?
**A:**
- It restricts the types that can be used as arguments in a generic class or method.
- Syntax: `<T extends Number>` means `T` can only be `Number` or its subclasses (like `Integer` or `Double`).
```java
public <T extends Number> void process(T number) {
    // Can safely call methods from the Number class
}
```

## Java / Generics
**Q:** What is the difference between `List<Object>` and `List<?>`?
**A:**
- `List<Object>`: A list that can hold any object. You can add any object to it.
- `List<?>`: A list of an unknown type. You can read from it (treating elements as `Object`), but you **cannot add** anything to it (except `null`) because the compiler doesn't know what specific type the list requires.

## Java / Generics
**Q:** Can you use primitive types with Generics?
**A:**
- No. You cannot use primitives like `int`, `double`, or `char` as type arguments.
- You must use their respective Wrapper Classes (`Integer`, `Double`, `Character`).
- Incorrect: `List<int>`
- Correct: `List<Integer>`

## Java / Generics
**Q:** What are Generic Methods?
**A:**
- Methods that introduce their own type parameters, independent of the class's type parameters.
- The type parameter is placed before the return type.
```java
public static <E> void printArray(E[] inputArray) {
    for (E element : inputArray) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}
```
